/**
Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters.

There are  chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from  to .
The -th chapter has  problems, numbered from  to .
Each page can hold up to  problems. There are no empty pages or unnecessary spaces, so only the last page of a chapter may contain fewer than  problems.
Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
The page number indexing starts at .
Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?

Note: See the diagram in the Explanation section for more details.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers  and  â€” the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per page respectively. 
The second line contains  integers , where  denotes the number of problems in the -th chapter.

Constraints

Output Format
