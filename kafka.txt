Kafka kernel config:
all brokers must have the same config‐ uration for the zookeeper.connect parameter.
all brokers in the cluster must have a unique value for the broker.id parameter.

set vm.swappiness to 1
set vm.dirty_background_ratio to 5
set vm.dirty_ratio to 60-80, also clustering/replication should be used for higher values

cat /proc/vmstat | egrep "dirty|writeback"
XFS file system rather than ext4
Setting the commit interval to a longer time than the default of 5 to force less frequent flushes is less safe

Change the default and maximum amount of mem‐ ory allocated for the send and receive buffers for each socket

set net.core.wmem_default and net.core.rmem_default to 131072, or 128KB. 
The parameters for the send and receive buffer maximum sizes are net.core.wmem_max and net.core.rmem_max, and a reasonable setting is 2097152, or 2MB.
set  net.ipv4.tcp_wmem and net.ipv4.tcp_rmem parameters, e.g. setting for each of these parameters is “4096 65536 2048000”
enabling TCP window scaling by setting net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling to 1 will allow clients to transfer data more efficiently
Increasing the value of net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog above the default of 1024 will allow a greater number of simultaenous connections to be accepted
Increasing the value of net.core.netdev_max_backlog to greater than the default of 1000 can assist with bursts of network traffic


G1
MaxGCPauseMillis default 200ms, it can be tuned to 20
InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent default is 45%, this can be lowered to 35

The best practice is to have each Kafka broker in a cluster installed in a different rack

If the consumer uses Zookeeper for offsets, each consumer will perform a Zookeeper write every interval for every partition it consumes. A reasonable interval for offset commits is one minute,

it is recommended that consumers using the latest Kafka libraries use Kafka for committing offsets, removing the dependency on Zookeeper.
