 * the zero-symbol of the * alphabet used. For a typical case consider a string of 
 * bits and count the * number of 1's in the string. In this binary case, 
 * it is also called the * population count. It is the digit sum of the 
 * binary representation of * a given number. Here, we will look into the 
 * available solutions and will * compare there running time to pick the fastest one.
